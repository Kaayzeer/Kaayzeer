# Hi there, I am Nikolas Rosinelli
### Front-end Developer 
I have a deep love for code and a passion for creating cutting-edge digital experiences. My expertise lies in HTML/CSS and JavaScript frameworks such as React and Redux, but I am constantly exploring new technologies to expand my skill set. Currently, I am also taking an online course on Node through Udemy to further broaden my knowledge.

I am dedicated to staying up-to-date on the latest industry trends. Whether working independently or as part of a team, I always strive to create high-quality, user-centered solutions.

My ultimate goal is to become a certified full-stack developer and to continue improving my coding skills. I believe that the field of technology is constantly evolving, and it is important to stay ahead of the curve in order to deliver the best possible outcomes for clients.

In my free time, I enjoy contributing to open-source projects and participating in hackathons. I am a firm believer in the power of collaboration and I value the opportunity to learn from others in the tech community. With my technical skills and passion for coding, I am confident in my ability to bring innovative solutions to any project.
